I started by navigating to where I wanted to create my folder with (cd). I created my folder with (mkdir GitHubRepoAssignment). I changed directory to the folder (cd) and initialized a git repository(git init). I created a readme.md with (nul> readme.md) and opened it (readme.md). I explained that the folder contained this file (but forgot to mention the secret git file). I checked the status of the repository (git status). I added the file to be tracked (git add .). It was commited with (git commit -m "Added readme.md"), then directed to the remote repository with (git remote add origin https://github.com/Brad-Wa/GitHubRepoAssignment.git and was pushed with (git push -u origin master). I then reopened the readme.md to add the hidden git file to the contents listed. That was followed up with (git add .), (git commit -m "Corrected the readme.md") and (git push)
