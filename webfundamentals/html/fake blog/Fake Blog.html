      <h1>Ostrava of Boletaria</h1>

      <p>Hello! Welcome to this place. Here I have written some details about myself for those intrigued by my struggle. Boletaria was once a mighty kingdom ruled by King Allant. With the Old One asleep all was well, but King Allant desired prosperity and wealth for his kingdom. The action of giving himself to the Old One's will brought calamity to the land. I was trying to reach my father, the king, but found nothing but a charade in his place.
